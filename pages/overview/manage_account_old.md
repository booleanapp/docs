## General settings

You can change your name, company name, email address and password in the “General” section of account page. 

## Credits
	
You need to buy credits to send surveys. One credit is worth one survey email. Once bought your credits never expire. Boolean deducts credits in small batches when sending surveys. You will not be charged for throttled surveys. You will be charged for surveys which bounced. When your credits run out surveys requests will be rejected.

### Buying credits

You can easily buy credits using credit/debit card in the “accounts” section. Follow these steps:
1.	Choose a credits pack. 
2.	Choose to enable or disable auto-renewal of credits. You if you enable Boolean will automatically re-order your chosen credit pack when you exhaust 90% of credits. You can disable auto-renew later if you change your mind.
3.	Give your credit/debit card details. You can opt to save your card for future purchases. You can delete it later if you change your mind. It is mandatory to save card if you choose to auto-renew credits. We use Stripe to store your card details.
4.	Complete purchase.
In case your credit card is charged and transaction failed please contact us at support@booleanapp.com. We will promptly complete the order or issue you a full refund.

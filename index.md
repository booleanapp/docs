## What is Boolean?

Boolean helps you send one question email surveys to your users. Recipients can answer the question with a single click from within their inbox.

## What kind of questions can I ask?

You can ask any question. You have to provide 2 choices for answer. One choice should be positive and other negative.

## How do I get insights from responses?

Our dashboard will show you real time scores on positive and negative responses. You can tag surveys with meta data and use our segmentation feature to slice and dice responses. Using segmentation, you will be able to find deficiencies in your product/service which are causing negative responses.

## Why only one question?

Traditional feedback surveys don’t get many responses because they are too long and specific. Boolean’s one question tremendously reduces the effort to respond resulting in high response rate. You don’t lose the specifics as survey meta data can be analyzed to find deficiencies in your product/service.

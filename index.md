## What is Boolean?

Boolean is a service for sending single question surveys by email. The survey format is one question and two predetermined answers.

## Features:
	
### Customizable look of survey

You can customize the survey to make it look like you sent it. Add your company's name, logo in email body, subject and sender name.

### Real time responses

See responses to your survey in real time in our dashboard.

### Segmentation

You can segment responses to find patterns in negative response. Read more about segmentation [here](/docs/analyze_responses.html#segmenting-responses). This is a paid feature.

### Throttling

Prevent spamming your users with too many surveys by capping the number of surveys a recipient can receive in a day, week and month. By default, a recipient will receive a maximum of 1 per day, 2 per week and 4 per month.

### RESTful API

Use our RESTful API to fully automate your survey workflow. Read API reference [here](/docs/v1_introduction.html).

### Comments

Survey recipients can add comments to their response.

### Easy unsubscribing

Recipients can opt-out of receiving surveys from an account by clicking unsubscribe link in footer of email. They can also opt out of Boolean surveys completely using the opt-out form in our website. You can unsubscribe recipients from specific surveys in your account using the [API](/docs/v1_unsubscribes.html). 

### Scheduling

Schedule surveys to be sent in a future time. Read [API docs](/docs/v1_messages.html) for more information.
